Welcome to the Git (Hello World) Lab! This lab is designed to introduce you to Git, a popular version control system used by developers all over the world. 

In this lab, you will learn how to set up a Git repository, make changes to your code, and commit those changes to the repository. You will also learn how to use basic Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
